# Phantom SDK Best Practices

## Transaction Signing

- Always use `signAndSendTransaction` for sending transactions. NEVER use `signTransaction` — it is NOT supported for embedded wallets and will throw an error.

## Provider Setup

- In React apps, always wrap the application root in `PhantomProvider` with a valid config object containing `appId`, `providers`, and `addressTypes`.
- In vanilla JS/TS apps, initialize a single `BrowserSDK` instance and reuse it as a singleton throughout the application. Never create multiple instances.

## Error Handling

- Always wrap `connect()`, `signAndSendTransaction()`, `signMessage()`, and other async SDK calls in try-catch blocks. Users can reject prompts at any time.

## Connection State

- Always check `isConnected` or verify account availability before attempting signing or transaction operations.
- Access accounts via `useAccounts()` hook (React) or `sdk.accounts` (Browser SDK) and filter by `chain` property.

## Imports

- Import `AddressType` from `@phantom/browser-sdk` when using the Browser SDK. Do not import it from other packages.

## App Registration

- Always register your app in [Phantom Portal](https://portal.phantom.com) and use a real `appId`. Social login and embedded wallet features require a valid `appId`.
